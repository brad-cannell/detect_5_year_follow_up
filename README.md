# DETECT 5 Year Follow-up Paper

This repository contains the code repository for the 5 Year Paper in the DETECT project.

# Overview

Each month, MedStar treats many older adults in their homes. While they are there, they are also supposed to screen for elder mistreatment (EM) using the DETECT tool.

This specific project analyzes the MedStar 5-year follow-up data. It involves the merger of Adult Protective Services (APS) and MedStar data to conduct analyses using the full follow-up period data.

The original MedStar records were recorded in Filemaker Pro. This repository contains the code used to process and analyze this data, including:
* Probabilistic matching to identify unique individuals.
* Demographic analyses and associations.
* Generation of consort diagrams for patient flow.
